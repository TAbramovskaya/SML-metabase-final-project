# Pharma RFM Analysis

For the analysis, a dataset was provided containing 45 128 transactions recorded between May 1 and June 9, 2022, including detailed information about customer purchases, transaction amounts, and loyalty program identifiers. A full description of the tables and field definitions is available [here](reports/db_overview.md).

As a result of the preliminary data processing, the number of transactions included in the analysis was reduced to 10 256. See a complete [overview of the data preparation steps](reports/data_preprocessing.md).

Thus, 2 285 customers were selected for the analysis, and we will divide them into groups according to the RFM methodology. Look at the [final share of transactions/receipts/customers](reports/rfm_base_overview.md) included in the analysis, or proceed directly to the [RFM study](reports/rfm_base_overview.md).
