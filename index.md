# Pharma RFM Analysis

For the analysis, a dataset was provided containing 45 128 transactions recorded between May 1 and June 9, 2022, including detailed information about customer purchases, transaction amounts, and loyalty program identifiers. A full description of the tables and field definitions is available in [db_overview.md](/reports/db_overview.md).

As a result of the preliminary data processing, the number of transactions included in the analysis was reduced to 10 183. A complete overview of the data preparation steps can be found in [data_preprocessing.md](/reports/data_preprocessing.md).

Thus, 2 280 customers were selected for the analysis, and we will divide them into groups according to the RFM methodology.
