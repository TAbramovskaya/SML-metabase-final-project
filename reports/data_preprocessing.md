Participation in the discount program is determined by the loyalty card barcode, recorded in the DR_BCDisc field. For some transactions, this field has the value 'NULL'. It turns out that within a single receipt, some items may be sold with a discount (and the corresponding transaction will include the customer’s card number), while other items are sold without a discount — for these, 'NULL' will be recorded in the receipt.

Thus, not all transactions with 'NULL' in the DR_BCDisc field are unidentifiable; some can still be accounted for using the full key that identifies the receipt. A complete analysis is provided in invalid_cards_overview.md [invalid_cards_overview.md](invalid_cards_overview.md). 

We also notice some outliers — six cards account for more than half of all receipts available in the dataset. A full analysis of this fact, along with other unusual behaviors of certain cards, can be found in [unusual_behavior_overview.md](unusual_behavior_overview.md).

The discount amount is represented as a positive value, which is then subtracted  from the cost of the items in the transaction. Therefore, the total cost of goods sold in a single transaction is calculated as: quantity sold × retail price – discount amount (DR_Kol × DR_CRoz – DR_SDisc). We will check whether all of these values are indeed positive. We will also examine the difference between the purchase price and the retail price. If there are product groups where the retail price is higher than the wholesale price, these may be items that should be excluded from our analysis.
