#Summary 

##What are we going to do?
We are going to analyze sales data from a chain pharmacy in Russia. We will use the RFM methodology and accompany our analysis with visualizations in Metabase.

##What do we have?
For the analysis, a dataset was provided containing 45 128 transactions recorded between May 1 and June 9, 2022, including detailed information about customer purchases, transaction amounts, and loyalty program identifiers. A full description of the table and field definitions is available on a [Source](db_overview.md) page.

##Where do we start?
We will start by examining the data and preparing it for analysis. As a result of the preliminary data processing, the number of transactions included in the analysis will be reduced to 10 256. See a complete overview of the [Data preparation steps](data_preprocessing.md).   

##What do we want to achieve?
We will perform an RFM analysis on the dataset. A set of 2 285 customers will be selected for the analysis, we will assign scores to them according to the RFM methodology and then divide them into segments based on behavioral patterns to work with them more effectively and we will divide them into groups according to the RFM methodology. Proceed directly to the [RFM calculation methodology](rfm_calculation_methodology.md).
