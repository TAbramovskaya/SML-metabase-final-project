## Recommendations for Better Data

We will begin with recommendations regarding the quality of the data provided for analysis.

First, **a longer period** of around three months seems more suitable for the transaction flow we observed. With the shorter period we had, the Recency metric became almost non-informative.

Second, **seasonality** should be taken into account. The data for May and early June do not fully reflect the actual customer flow.

Third, it appears important to **indicate the type of each item** (whether it is a medicinal product or not). We see that increasing the number of items in the receipt can significantly improve the Monetary metric without increasing visit frequency. Moreover, recommending non-medicinal products is far more promising than trying to sell a customer a medicinal product they do not need. At the moment, recommendations in this area can only be made based on the number of items in the receipt.

This group is characterized by a fairly high average receipt and a large number of items per purchase. However, most of these customers visited us only once. We see that they do not economize on medications and are willing to spend substantial amounts. 

_Our task is to bring these customers back to the pharmacy for follow-up purchases in the near future._

    - a time-limited promotion (for example, for three months) with an increased discount rate on their loyalty card;
    - introduce them to the extended assortment via email newsletters;
    - if holidays are approaching, send special offers on cosmetics and/or dietary supplements;

    Return to the [segment description](rfm_behavior.md#promising-customers) in the Behavior & Segmentation section.

These visitors came to us only once for a small set of products, but the total value of their purchase was high. We also see that their discount rate is among the highest (exceeded only by Pharmacy Friends). 

_We would like these customers to return for a subsequent purchase._

    | **Avg. Receipt**       | **460.03** |
    | **Avg. Number of Items Purchased**    | **2.49** |

    Return to the [segment description](rfm_behavior.md#pharmacy-friends) in the Behavior & Segmentation section.

This customer segment visits the pharmacy frequently, which results in a high Monetary value, but their average receipt is relatively low. They have high needs for regular pharmacy visits.

!!! warning "With caution"
    Care should be taken with general email campaigns for this group. They do not show interest in purchasing expensive products, and overly persistent offers through newsletters may annoy them. These customers are primarily willing to cover their (considerable) medical needs at the pharmacy.

_Our goal is to support their willingness to visit us while respecting their elevated needs._

!!! success "We can offer them"
    
    - a newsletter, excluding premium items (such as high-end cosmetics);
    - including commonly used products available in supermarkets;
    - highlighting special offers on medical devices (digital thermometers, blood pressure monitors, glucometers, etc.).

    Return to the [segment description](rfm_behavior.md#neighborhood-customers) in the Behavior & Segmentation section.

These customers most likely find it convenient to visit this pharmacy; the majority of them came in no more than three weeks ago, and they probably do not have a consistent need for medicinal products. Special offers are unlikely to bring these customers back to the pharmacy. It may not even be worth bothering them with promotional messages.

_Our goal is to remain a convenient, easily accessible pharmacy for them._

!!! success "We can offer them"
    
    - SMS notifications, such as "holiday opening hours."

The last group is the largest, including more than one-third of all visitors, who came to us only once for a small purchase. We do not know their behavior when they need a larger quantity of medications. We can provide them with an extended promotional mailing in the hope that some of them will choose to return.

_Our task is to remind them that they have previously visited our pharmacy and that they are part of the loyalty program._

!!! success "We can offer them"
    
    - regular newsletters featuring both medical and non-medical products, branch locations, and information about the bonus program.
