# Pharma RFM Dashboard in Metabase

### Overview

This project is dedicated to performing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on transactional data from a retail pharmacy chain. The results will be visualized and explored using Metabase.

### The dataset

The dataset was provided by the educational project Simulative and represents real transaction data from the loyalty program of one of the pharmacy chains in Russia.

The dataset contains 451,298 transactions recorded between May 1 and June 9, 2022, including detailed information about customer purchases, transaction amounts, and loyalty program identifiers.

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to prepare, analyze, and segment customer data using the RFM framework.


Specifically, the project aims to:

- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.

- Aggregate transactional data at the customer level to calculate RFM metrics:

  - Recency – how recently a customer made a purchase.

  - Frequency – how often a customer makes purchases.

  - Monetary – how much a customer spends in total.

- Assign RFM scores and segments to customers based on their behavior patterns.

- Identify key customer groups.

- Provide actionable insights that can support marketing strategies, customer retention, and loyalty program optimization.

- Visualize results using Metabase.
