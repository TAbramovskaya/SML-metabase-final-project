### Overview

This project is dedicated to performing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on transactional data from a retail pharmacy chain. The dataset was provided by the educational project Simulative and represents real transaction data from the loyalty program of one of the pharmacy chains in Russia.

The dataset contains 451,298 transactions recorded between May 1 and June 9, 2022, including detailed information about customer purchases, transaction amounts, and loyalty program identifiers.
The primary objective of this project is to prepare, analyze, and segment customer data using the RFM framework — a classic marketing analysis technique that evaluates customer value based on their purchasing behavior.

### Objective

Specifically, the project aims to:

Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.

Aggregate transactional data at the customer level to calculate RFM metrics:

Recency – how recently a customer made a purchase.

Frequency – how often a customer makes purchases.

Monetary – how much a customer spends in total.

Assign RFM scores and segments to customers based on their behavior patterns.

Identify key customer groups, such as loyal customers, potential churners, and high-value buyers.

Provide actionable insights that can support marketing strategies, customer retention, and loyalty program optimization.

Ultimately, this analysis will help the company understand its customer base, prioritize marketing efforts, and design targeted campaigns to improve engagement and profitability.
